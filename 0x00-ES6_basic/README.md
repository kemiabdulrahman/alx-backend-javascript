0x00. ES6 Basics.
Task 0:
	Modify

	function taskFirst to instantiate variables using const
	function taskNext to instantiate variables using let


Task 1:
	Given what you’ve read about var and hoisting, modify the variables inside the function taskBlock so that the variables aren’t overwritten inside the conditional block.


Task 2:
	Rewrite the following standard function to use ES6’s arrow syntax of the function add (it will be an anonymous function after)

Task 3: 
	Condense the internals of the following function to 1 line - without changing the name of each function/variable.

	Hint: The key here to define default parameter values for the function parameters.


Task 4: 
	Modify the following function to return the number of arguments passed to it using the rest parameter syntax


Task 5:
	Using spread syntax, concatenate 2 arrays and each character of a string by modifying the function below. Your function body should be one line long.


Task 6:	    
	Rewrite the return statement to use a template literal so you can the substitute the variables you’ve defined.

Task 7:
	Notice how the keys and the variable names are the same?

	Modify the following function’s budget object to simply use the keyname instead.

Task 8:
	Rewrite the getBudgetForCurrentYear function to use ES6 computed property names on the budget object


Task 9:
	Rewrite getFullBudgetObject to use ES6 method properties in the fullBudget object



Task 10:
	Rewrite the function appendToEachArrayValue to use ES6’s for...of operator. And don’t forget that var is not ES6-friendly.
	


Task 11:
	Write a function named createEmployeesObject that will receive two arguments:

	departmentName (String)
	employees (Array of Strings)


Task 12:
	Write a function named createReportObject whose parameter, employeesList, is the return value of the previous function createEmployeesObject.

Task 13:
	Write a function named createIteratorObject, that will take into argument a report Object created with the previous function createReportObject.

	This function will return an iterator to go through every employee in every department.

Task 14:
	Finally, write a function named iterateThroughObject. The function’s parameter reportWithIterator is the return value from createIteratorObject.
